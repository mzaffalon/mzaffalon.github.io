The lecturer did not provide notes so a colleague and I wrote them: the <a href="https://github.com/mzaffalon/smith-system-identification-notes/blob/main/notes/notes.pdf">notes</a> have not been reviewed and surely contain errors. We also make the solutions of the coding exercises available since they were not provided.</p> <h3 id=227-0216-00l_computational_control_fs2023 ><a href="#227-0216-00l_computational_control_fs2023" class=header-anchor >227-0216-00L Computational Control FS2023</a></h3> <p>A class on advanced control systems given by <a href="https://www.bsaver.io/">Dr. Bolognani</a> at ETH that includes model predictive control, system identification, Markov decision processes and reinforcement learning. Since this class was given for the first time and the course notes were still missing, I wrote them: <a href="https://github.com/mzaffalon/bolognani-computational-control-notes/blob/main/notes.pdf">notes</a> have been only partially reviewed and surely contain errors.</p> <h2 id=227-0103-00l_control_systems_hs2022 ><a href="#227-0103-00l_control_systems_hs2022" class=header-anchor >227-0103-00L Control Systems HS2022</a></h2> <p>An introductory class to control systems &#40;my first&#41; given by <a href="http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~floriand/">Prof. Dörfler</a> at ETH. The course material focuses only on linear systems: stability, PID and their tuning, controller design via &quot;loop shaping&quot;, LQ Regulator, optimal state estimation.</p> <p>I appreciated how Dörfler stayed after class to answer students&#39; questions.</p> <p>I also had the pleasure to work with a <a href="https://ikaftan.github.io/">talented young engineer</a>.</p> <h2 id=control_systems_lab_helicopter_on_a_stick ><a href="#control_systems_lab_helicopter_on_a_stick" class=header-anchor >Control Systems Lab: Helicopter on a Stick</a></h2> <p>While taking Dörfler&#39;s class, a colleague and I did a lab where we controlled an helicopter on a stick: this lowers the number of degrees of freedom from 6 to two. Here is the <a href="https://gitlab.com/mzaffalon/IfA-lab_helikopter-II/-/blob/main/report/main.pdf">report</a>.
